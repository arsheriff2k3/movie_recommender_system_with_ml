## Movie Recommendation System

This is a movie recommendation system that suggests similar movies based on user input. It uses a similarity matrix and cosine similarity scores to determine the similarity between movies.
Requirements

To run the code, you need the following dependencies installed:

    Python (version 3.6 or above)
    NumPy
    pandas
    difflib
    scikit-learn

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn

Usage

    Clone the repository or download the code files.

    Make sure you have a dataset of movies available in a format compatible with the code. The dataset should contain a column named 'title' that contains the movie titles.

    Open the Python script file in your preferred editor.

    Set the appropriate path or filename to load your movie dataset in the movies_data variable.

    Run the script.

    Enter the name of your favorite movie when prompted.

    The system will suggest similar movies based on the similarity score. The top 30 similar movies will be displayed in the console.

Notes

    Ensure that your movie dataset is properly formatted and compatible with the code. Adjust the code accordingly if your dataset has a different structure.

    You may need to modify the code if your dataset has additional columns or if the column names differ from the code assumptions.

    It is essential to have a similarity matrix or a similarity calculation mechanism implemented before using this code. Make sure the similarity variable is defined and contains the necessary similarity scores.

    This code is a basic example and can be further enhanced or customized based on your specific requirements.
